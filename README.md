# CRM-Data-Analysis
The objective of this analysis was to understand customer behavior and sales performance by analyzing transaction data.
Through RFM segmentation and cohort analysis, I was able to identify high value customer groups, retention trends, and the
timing of key purchases. These insights later supported strategic recommendations i would outline, focusing on boosting
engagement, reducing churn, and driving targeted growth through smarter marketing and loyalty initiatives.

By grouping customers based on their first day purchase and their subsequent purchases over time, i was able to segment them and formulate the respective strategies to further boost customer retention.
